## Daniel Brown:

When working in a team I often take on some form of leadership or guidance role. In this project I have therefore gravitated towards taking responsibility for understanding the project as a whole, and trying to ensure that others in the team understand how the different aspects fit together. We had a little trouble getting started, so I took time creating a couple of documents with a rough schema for how the program would be constructed, and I believe that this helped us to move forward and gave us something to ”hang our ideas on”.

I am naturally inclined to work alone, although over the years have come to learn the value of working in a team, and this project has been no exception. Having daily meetings has helped keep me structured, and having others to discuss ideas with has been immensely helpful. I worked alone for assignments 1 and 2, so it was of value for me to work with others on C code and learn from their different coding styles and techniques. The pair programming was useful to have a direct contact to discuss ideas with, and I think it is this aspect that was most useful to me. My attempts to code together simultaneously with others via LiveShare reaffirmed my conviction that I prefer to write code alone, as I found the experience awkward and not a very efficient use of our time. I believe there is a role for this kind of shared coding, in discussing bugs or particular aspects of the code, but I like to keep this to a minimum and do the majority of coding without distractions.

I have not learnt so much “C-specific” on this project, although the experience of constructing more complex algorithms, as well as the need to write clear and readable code for others have been valuable learning experiences. Above all learning to use Git and GitHub, and generally organising a project of this kind, have been the greatest takeaways for me.

I have found time logging a little tricky. I tend to work in long blocks later in the day, when there are less distractions from meetings, etc. I have therefore used a rough estimate of the total number of hours I worked each day, and attempted to divide this into the various activities. I have on a number of occasions researched a little deeper into certain topics than was necessary for the project out of personal interest, which makes it difficult judging how much of this time should count towards the project itself. The different activities are also often very much interwoven, and I don’t always see the value spending time trying to unthread these.

My biggest fail was in not drawing our attention sufficiently to some of the structural issues concerning the inter-operation of the different modules that I had foreseen earlier in the project, which later proved to create issues for us. My biggest win was in creating thorough tests that highlighted these issues early enough so that they could be fixed, which otherwise may have led to a lot of lost time debugging in the run up to the deadline.


Min "Biggest win" har varit nog även varit ```find_root_set```. Trots problemen den orsakade så lärde jag mig mycket av att utveckla den, såsom att leta igenom stacken efter pekare som pekar in i vår heap. Det var kändes som min "Biggest win" då vi fick ```find_root_set``` att fungera korrekt
